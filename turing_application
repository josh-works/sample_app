# Rock Climbing, Big Falls, and Boldness

## Context

Most people start climbing by _top roping_. Top roping is when the rope goes from the climber's harness to the top of the wall and back down to the belayer.

After a climber learns the basics of climbing, they often progress to _lead climbing_, where the rope runs from the climber straight down to the belayer, through intermediate points of protection along the way. The important difference between _leading_ and _top roping_ is that when the climber falls "on lead", he often falls quite a ways before the rope pulls tight.

Top rope falls are uneventful in every way. It is difficult to discern the difference between a true unintended fall, and someone just sitting in the rope.

Lead falls, on the other hand, can be quite eventful. [Please watch this five seconds of a lead fall](https://youtu.be/kdAfi2FhjTg?t=1m38s).

You can see that the climber fell from the top of the wall almost to the floor. Behind him his belayer _shoots_ up into the air:

As you may imagine, the prospect of a fall like this happening to _you_ while climbing is terrifying. 

Yet, look at the end of the video, [at 1:44](https://youtu.be/kdAfi2FhjTg?t=1m44s) - both the climber and belayer are _laughing_. 

What's wrong with them? Are they insane and unable to judge risk? 

Not at all! (Well, they might be insane, but evaluating just this two minute video, everything about their climbing looks totally fine.)

This video captures the end-goal of where most lead climbers want to be: _take huge falls and then **laugh them off**._

## Take big falls, laugh them off

Fear is how your subconscious mind tells your conscious mind that it is uneasy with the situation. If you've heard of the "[rider and the elephant](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-rider-and-the-elephant-metaphor)", you know that your rational mind is almost helpless to drive change in your subconscious mind. 

When your subconscious mind (the elephant) starts stampeding along, the rider can barely hang on. When you're feeling fear while climbing, your subconscious mind is tearing through the woods, and no amount of self-talk can bring it back under control. 

Some of the best news an aspiring lead climber will ever hear is this: 

>You can train your subconscious mind to be bold only when you are not _actively_ feeling fear. 

This injunction has profound implications, like "if you feel fear, stop the exercise and back up to a smaller step."

Exploring these exercises and steps is beyond the context of this overview.

There's the set-up for how to conquer fear while lead climbing. It'll take a few more words to sketch out the answer to this fear. I've written more about fear [here](http://josh.works/blog/2014/09/30/why-your-belayer-is-keeping-you-from-climbing-harder) and [here](http://josh.works/blog/2013/06/06/climbing-in-decking-range) and [here](http://www.climbersguide.co/everything-you-need-to-know-about-giving-a-soft-catch-for-a-falling-climber/) and guest-posted [here](http://cruxcrush.com/2014/12/15/a-step-by-step-approach-to-conquering-lead-climbing-fear/)
